Elektron: A Pluggable Mesos framework with power-aware capabilities
===================================================================

Elektron is a Mesos framework that behaves as a playground for developers to experiment with different scheduling policies to launch ad-hoc jobs.
Elektron is designed as a lightweight, configurable framework, which can be used in conjunction with built-in power-capping policies to reduce the peak power and/or energy usage of co-scheduled tasks.

#Features
* Pluggable Scheduling policies
* Pluggable Power-Capping strategies
* Cluster resource monitoring
